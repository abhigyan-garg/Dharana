The app contains three different pages which can be navigated through by swiping or by using the BottomNavigationView. Each page contains an image or animation representative of a certain exercise. You can play the animation by tapping the start button at the top-left of the page. The image can be changed from a man to a woman and vice-versa by clicking the appropriate icon at the top-right of the screen. If you wish to mute the music, you can tap the music icon at the top-right. The settings icon can be used to configure the animation times for each page.
